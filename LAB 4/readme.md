# ðŸ“˜ DSA Lab 4

This lab focuses on problems related to **Stacks**, **Strings**, and **Backtracking**.  
Each question applies fundamental data structure concepts to solve real-world string and array problems.

## ðŸ§© Questions

### **Q1. Palindrome Check using Stack**
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward and forward.  
Write a program using a **stack** to check whether a given string `s` is a palindrome.

### **Q2. Compare Strings with Backspaces**
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return **true** if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors.  
`'#'` represents a backspace character.

#### Examples:
- **Input:** `s = "ab#c"`, `t = "ad#c"`  
  **Output:** `true`  
  **Explanation:** Both `s` and `t` become `"ac"`.  

- **Input:** `s = "a#c"`, `t = "b"`  
  **Output:** `false`  
  **Explanation:** `s` becomes `"c"` while `t` becomes `"b"`.

### **Q3. Generate All Permutations**
Given an array `nums` of distinct integers, return all possible **permutations**.  
The answer can be returned in any order.

#### Examples:
- **Input:** `nums = [1,2,3]`  
  **Output:** `[[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]]`

- **Input:** `nums = [0,1]`  
  **Output:** `[[0,1], [1,0]]`

---

### **Q4. Word Search in a Grid**
Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return **true** if the word exists in the grid.  
The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically).  
Each cell can be used only once per word.
