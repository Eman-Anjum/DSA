 Questions

 Question 1
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.  
Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together  
the nodes of the first two lists. Return the head of the merged linked list.  

Example:  
```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

---

 Question 2
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once.  
Return the linked list sorted as well.  

Example:  
```
Input: [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

---

 Question 3
Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.  
Use mergesort.  

Example:  
```
Input: [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

---

 Question 4
Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.  

Example:  
```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
```

---

 Question 6
