# ðŸ“˜ DSA Lab 3

This lab focuses on **Linked Lists** and **Queues**, covering concepts like circular queues, doubly linked lists, and browser history implementation using linked data structures.

---

## ðŸ§© Questions

### **Q1. Circular Queue using Circular Linked List**
Implement a class of a **Circular Queue** using a **Circular Linked List**.

---

### **Q2. Double Ended Queue using Doubly Linked List**
Implement a class of a **Double Ended Queue (Deque)** using a **Doubly Linked List**.

---

### **Q3. Concatenate Two Doubly Linked Lists**
Create two **Doubly Linked Lists**, say `L` and `M`.
- `L` should contain all even elements from 2 to 10.  
- `M` should contain all odd elements from 1 to 9.  
Create a new list `N` by concatenating list `L` and `M`.

---

### **Q4. Sort List N in Descending Order**
Sort the contents of list `N` (created in Q3) in **descending order**.

---

### **Q5. Browser History Implementation**
Implement a **Browser History** class to simulate back and forward navigation in a web browser.

#### Class Structure:
- **BrowserHistory(string homepage)**  
  Initializes the object with the homepage of the browser.

- **void visit(string url)**  
  Visits a new URL from the current page and clears all forward history.

- **string back(int steps)**  
  Moves back `steps` times in the history.  
  If `steps` is greater than the available history, move as far back as possible.  
  Returns the current URL after moving back.

- **string forward(int steps)**  
  Moves forward `steps` times in the history.  
  If `steps` is greater than the available forward history, move as far forward as possible.  
  Returns the current URL after moving forward.
